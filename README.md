# Worst Pong AI using NEAT Algorithm

This project implements a simple Pong game and trains an AI using the NEAT algorithm.

## Features

- Simple Pong game implementation
- Training of AI using NEAT algorithm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hetkpatel/Worst-Pong-AI.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/worst-pong-ai.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script with the desired mode:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - To train the AI, set the mode to `Mode.TRAIN` in `main.py` and run it.
   - To test the trained AI, set the mode to `Mode.TEST` in `main.py` and run it.

4. Monitor the training or testing progress and observe the AI's performance in the Pong game.
